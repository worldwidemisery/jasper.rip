      took me long enough to get something up, but here it is — no templates, no frameworks, no bullshit. just html, css, and enough php to barely hold it together. welcome to the personal website.  
      <br /><br />
      part of the reason i made this is because i’ve been craving some kind of creative outlet that isn’t poisoned by surveillance systems, invisible leashes and engagement economy. not trying to perform. not trying to optimise anything. just wanted a place to put shit. a place that feels like my own.  
      <br /><br />
      so far that’s looked like building this site and making
      <a href="https://github.com/worldwidemisery/pycamp" target="_blank">pycamp</a>, a little cli tool for digging through
      <a href="https://bandcamp.com" target="_blank">bandcamp</a> by genre. nothing flashy.. just fetches, parses, scrapes, and gives you albums on whatever tip you're after. i’ve been messing with scripts, broken weakauras, weird cli tools, addons, whatever gets the brain moving. and i can feel that spark again.  
      <br /><br />
      it’s been a couple of years since i made anything just for fun. like really
      <b>made</b> something. not for work, not for someone else, not to look good. just building out of curiosity or frustration or boredom. and fuck it feels good. it’s invigorating in a way i forgot i needed.  
      <br /><br />
      i’m not trying to brand myself or anything. this isn’t a portfolio. it’s just what happens when you put your head down and make shit again. maybe it’s ugly, maybe it breaks. but i fucking made it.  
      <br /><br />
      like gorilla biscuits told me, start today..
